Spring Constant Machine Sudo Code



Start_button pressed
	LCD_display reads "Test Begining - Test 1"
	Sero_motor moves forward with spring testing operation
	

   FUCNTION (Spring Test Operation)
	Print to LCD "Test in Progress"
	Move Sero_motor forward until Load_cell detects force
	Print to LCD "Calculating..."
	Move forward an additional .05 inches
	From this point zero the value for spring_force and distance_x
	Move Servo_motor forward slowly until force = 4 lbs. At that point calculate the value of the spring constant k (using hook's law F=kX). 
	Zero force and distance variables and reverse motor slowly until force = -.1 lbs - calculate spring constant k and average with the value calculated from the forward motion.
 	Print to LCD "Spring Constant: k_value"
	Return Servo Motor to Home position.
